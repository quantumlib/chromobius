        Args:
            dem: A stim detector error model. The detector error model must satisfy:
                1. Basis+Color annotations. Every detector that appears in an error
                    must specify coordinate data including a fourth coordinate. The 4th
                    coordinate indicates the basis and color of the detector with the
                    convention:
                        0 = Red X

                2. Rainbow triplets. Bulk errors with three symptoms in one basis should
                    have one symptom of each color. Errors with three symptoms that
                    repeat a color will cause an exception unless they can be decomposed
                    into other basic errors.
                3. Movable excitations. It needs to be possible to combine bulk errors
                    to form simpler errors with one or two symptoms that can be used to
                    move or destroy excitations. If bulk errors don't have this

                    there's no way to move the excitation along that path.
                4. Matchable-avoids-color. In parts of the dem that correspond to a
                    matchable code, at least one of the colors must be avoided.
                    Otherwise the matcher may be given a problem that can be solved
                    locally, but when lifting it needs to be solved non-locally.

        Args:
            dets: A bit packed numpy array of detection event data. The array can either
                be 1-dimensional (a single shot to decode) or 2-dimensional (multiple
                shots to decode, with the first axis being the shot axis and the second
                axis being the detection event byte axis).

                The array's dtype must be np.uint8. If you have an array of dtype
                np.bool_, you have data that's not bit packed. You can pack it by
                using `np.packbits(array, bitorder='little')`. But ideally you
                should attempt to never have unpacked data in the first place,
                since it's 8x larger which can be a large performance loss. For
                example, stim's sampler methods all have a `bit_packed=True` argument
                that cause them to return bit packed data.

        Returns:
            A bit packed numpy array of observable flip data. The array will have
            the same number of dimensions as the dets argument.

            If dets is a 1D array, then the result has:
                shape = (math.ceil(num_obs / 8),)
                dtype = np.uint8
            If dets is a 2D array, then the result has:
                shape = (dets.shape[0], math.ceil(num_obs / 8),)
                dtype = np.uint8

            To determine if the observable with index k was flipped in shot s, compute:
                `bool((result[s, k // 8] >> (k % 8)) & 1)`
